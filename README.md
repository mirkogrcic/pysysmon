# pysysmon
Linux system monitor for CPU,GPU,Memory and Disk usage, realtime and logging for later. I'm planning to make a diagram gui just like the Proces Hacker(Windows only) resource window just with more features(scrolling on x axis, top process list on hover), will port it to C++ when it's done(hard to test on C++ for me).
